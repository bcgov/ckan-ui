# BC DATA CATALOGUE

The B.C. Data Catalogue is the place to find B.C. Government data, applications and web services. Government ministries and many broader public sector agencies publish their data resources in the Catalogue.  This data can be used to make informed decisions and create opportunities for the benefit of all British Columbians.

The Catalogue describes thousands of government datasets and is designed to help users find, access, explore and reuse this extensive collection of data. All ministries and some Broader Public Sector agencies register data in the Catalogue.

Catalogued "data" is broadly encompassing and includes raw data, applications and web services. Much of the data are released under the Open Government License - British Columbia that permits a wide range of uses, including commercial use and re-distribution.

The data described in the Catalogue spans many sectors related to governmentâ€™s delivery of services, including Natural Resources, Finance, Economy, Education, Health and Safety, Justice, Transportation and Social Services.

Catalogue users can subscribe to Catalogue updates and contact government Data Custodians, who are responsible for the information and can help answer questions about the data.

The B.C. Data Catalogue is powered by CKAN open source software and is managed by DataBC.
