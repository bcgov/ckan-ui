# BC DATA CATALOGUE - STANDARDS AND GUIDELINES

The pages in this section provide information on the standards and guidelines for data publication in the BC Data Catalogue (BCDC).

1. [Open Government Licence - British Columbia](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/open_data.html) mandates that all data that obtains this licence is listed in the Catalogue.
2. [B.C.'s Map Hub](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dps_maphub_w.html) requires the publication of metadata records in the catalogue for public facing data, maps and apps.
3. [File-Based Content](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dsg_bcdc_file_based_content.html) identifies the file formats which must be used when publishing Open Datasets and provides guidelines for specific physical file formats in order to optimize datasets for machine processing.
4. [Metadata Standards](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dsg_bcdc_metadata_standards.html) describes recommended metadata standards and provides a high-level summary of metadata requirements for data objects when publishing data to the BC Data Catalogue.
5. [Roles and Responsibilities](https://bcgov.github.io/data-publication/pages/dsg_bcdc_roles_responsibilities.html) describes why the roles and responsibilities of the Data Custodians, Managers and Stewards are important and the obligations of each of these.
