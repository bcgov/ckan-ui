## BC Data Catalogue

The BC Data Catalogue is the place to find B.C. Government data, applications and web services. Government ministries and many broader public sector agencies publish their data resources in the Catalogue. The data in the catalogue can be used to make informed decisions and create opportunities for the benefit of all British Columbians.

The BC Data Catalogue is powered by [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) and follows the [ISO19115](https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html) standards. The B.C. Government participates in this software project, sharing developments with a community of international users.
