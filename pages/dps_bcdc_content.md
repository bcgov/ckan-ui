|:---|:---|
|SDE_BINARY| This is the older ESRI based geometry that used to be what the bcgw was, most minitiries do not use this anymore
|SDO_GEOMETRY| This is Oracle geometry and what the BCGW and NRM uses predominately as their datatype.
|ST_GEOMETRY| This is the current ESRI based geometry.

**Object Name** is the object name as it appears in the BCGW: _SCHEMA.OBJECT_. Example: WHSE_BASEMAPPING.NTS_BC_CONTOUR_LINES_125M

**Spatial Datatype** refers to the datatype in the database. For data stored in the BCGW, choose SDO_GEOMETRY.  If you are unsure, leave this field blank.

1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Click the **Finish** button on the _Successfully added._ pop-up.

Publicly visible datasets in the BCGW that are made available in iMapBC will also have WMS and KML links created and added to the metadata record. The addition of these resources is handled through an automated script.

#### FILE AND URL RESOURCES

The **+Add New Resource** button allows you to upload a file that will be stored in the Catalogue Data Store, or use a link to your geographc dataset. If linking to a dataset, ensure it is in a location that is accessible for end-users.
